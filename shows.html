        <h1>My Film TV shows</h1>
        <h3>Black Snow by Matthew Saville.</h3>
        <p>Black Snow (2023) is an Australian crime drama series that follows the reopening of a 1994 cold case murder
            in a small North Queensland town. When a time capsule is unearthed at a high school, new evidence emerges
            about the unsolved murder of 17-year-old Isabel Baker, a girl from the South Sea Islander community.
            Detective James Cormack is assigned to investigate, uncovering long-buried secrets and tensions within the
            town. As he digs deeper, he discovers hidden connections between the townspeople and the tragic events of
            the past. The series blends mystery and drama, exploring themes of justice, culture, and the impact of the
            past on the present.

        <h3>Mr. Bean by John Birkin, Paul Weiland, and John Howard Davies</h3>
        <p>Mr. Bean is a British comedy TV series starring Rowan Atkinson as the quirky and often clueless
            Mr. Bean. The show follows his misadventures in everyday situations, such as going to the dentist, shopping,
            or taking an exam, where his unusual problem-solving methods lead to chaos. It relies heavily on physical
            comedy and visual humor, with very little dialogue, making it accessible to audiences worldwide. Mr. Bean is
            often accompanied by his beloved teddy bear, Teddy, and drives his signature green Mini car. The series
            became a global phenomenon, leading to animated adaptations, movies, and a lasting legacy in comedy.</p>
