            <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>Interest is based on your hardwork and dedication,
                when you don't put a work on it, your true potential on your interest can disappear. <sup>2</sup>One of
                my interest are playing some instruments, and i mean instruments. <sup>3</sup>I'm not bragging it because
                i workhard on it. <sup>4</sup>But one of my favorite instrument that i played is drums. <sup></sup>I remembered
                when my brother is teaching me how to play drums.<sup>5</sup> On that day, i'm not invested to play any
                instruments because i don't know how to do it and to proper fundamentals.<sup>6</sup> But i keep it and
                improve it step by step. <sup>7</sup>Then, on the battle that i mentioned on the last activity, when we
                fought on battle of the bands.<sup>8</sup> I realized that my brother is right, i can truly maximize my
                potential on playing drums.<sup>9</sup> This also became my hobby but for a while because we have a
                battle of the band.<sup>10</sup> But until now, when my bandmates are having gatherings, i'm always G to
                play again and just have fun.<sup>11</sup> I also play guitar, bass guitar, and piano. <sup>12</sup>When pandemic
                days, i got nothing to do but play some instrument. <sup>13</sup>This became my pass time because we all
                know how bored pandemic days are.<sup>14</sup> So i play and play each and everyday even if i'm alone.<sup>15</sup>
                This put a spark in my instrument passion because when i was a kid, i dreamed to play some
                instrument to impress my family and friends. <sup>16</sup>When interest becomes a habit, that's where talent comes out.<sup>17</sup>
                And ofcourse, i'm interested at coding. <sup>18</sup>I chose this course not just because it has money, but i enjoy every challenges
                that IT industry gave to me.<sup>19</sup> One of the reason also is because when i was a kid, i always watched my brother to code 
                when he was in college, so that became my inspiration to code because i wanna be like him soon.<sup>20</sup>One of my interest too is working
                out, because this helps my body to improve.<sup>21</sup> Going to the gym became my everyday life, watching yourself
                improve physically is the best feeling ever, not just being there for the clout but being there to have bigger body
                is having a mindset to improve.<sup>22</sup>But overall, interest is one of the reason why we all have talents, 
                because we are curious in life and how's it gonna be.<sup>23</sup> On that simple curiousity, 
                some of us develop skills, hobbies, and interest. And some of us became good in life and on our daliy battles.
