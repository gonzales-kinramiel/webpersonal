            <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>Hobbies are one of the most enjoying thing to do because
                this helps us in our everyday life, having fun while you learn something is one of the traits on
                having hobbies.<sup>2</sup> One of the most hobbies that i love is playing basketball.<sup>3</sup> This sports helped me
                to develop my skills and talents, because while playing this sports, my mind and heart are full
                of happiness and love.<sup>4</sup> This sports helped me on my everyday life because it improve my physical
                and mental health, and this helped me to clear my mind while playing it and benefits my body.<sup>5</sup>
                Basketball also helped me to provide to my parents, because i gave some of my earnings,
                jerseys,and trophies to my parents.<sup>6</sup> And i'm so happy because they always have a smile on their
                faces and assuring me that they are proud of me.<sup>7</sup> One of my hobbies also is playing playing video
                games.<sup>8</sup> Playing games became my hobby because when it's my free time, i always play some games in
                my pc and my phone.<sup>9</sup> When i'm resting after training, this always comes in my mind and playing it
                became my happiness because when i'm playing with my friends, we always laugh and we always
                enjoy to play the games.<sup>10</sup> Also, one of my hobbies is to ride a bike.<sup>11</sup> This always helps me to
                rewind in life and can also help me to improve my physicality and to be healthy.<sup>12</sup> Riding a bike
                while on the top of the mountain are so peaceful and quiet, always watching the sunset while
                resting on the top became my passion.<sup>13</sup> I remembered when we are riding with my friends, i'm not
                in condition that time, when we go uphill the mountain, i got dizzy and i throw out.<sup>14</sup> So my
                friends take care of me until we reach the top of the mountain, and luckily i got well on the
                top of the mountain, and my friend said that "Pre, muntik kana kunin ni Lord, sakto pataas pa
                naman tayo", we laughed about it and it was a great time.<sup>15</sup> I dont know if this is a hobby, but
                one of my hobbies is to clean the house.<sup>16</sup> It's like my stress reliever when i cleaned the house
                and make me proud of myself.<sup>17</sup> It's just weird because cleaning our house helps me when i'm stress
                and having anxiety.<sup>18</sup> It's so peaceful when you're the only one on the house and decide to clean
                up.<sup>19</sup> My last hobby are going hiking. <sup>20</sup>Because this helps me to my physical health and helps
                me to rewind my mind.<sup>21</sup>We have many mountains in our province so it became my passion to hike even
                it's tiring.</blockqoute>
