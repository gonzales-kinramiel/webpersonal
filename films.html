        <h3>Coach Carter by Thomas Carter(based on true story)</h3>
        <p>Coach Carter (2005) is a sports drama film based on the true story of Ken Carter, a high school basketball
            coach who prioritizes academics over athletics. When Carter takes over as coach of the struggling Richmond
            High School basketball team, he implements strict rules, including a contract requiring players to maintain
            good grades and respectful behavior. Despite their initial resistance, the team begins to excel on the
            court, gaining recognition and success. However, Carter controversially locks the gym and suspends the team
            when he discovers they are failing in academics, sparking backlash from the community. In the end, the
            players come to understand the value of education and discipline, with many of them achieving success beyond
            basketball.</p>
