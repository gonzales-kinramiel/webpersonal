            <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>When i was young, my mom always taught me how to communicate,
                even when i'm mad, sad, happy, etc. <sup>2</sup>Because communication can helped us to talk our thoughts and
                emotions by saying it calmly and saying it from the bottom of your heart. <sup>3</sup>Communication skills
                helped me to have friends in my YFC days, because communication is the key from making a friendship that you ever had
                and this helps us to improve ourself to others.<sup>4</sup> Communication skills
                also helped to make friends here in Manila. <sup>5</sup>Because if you have a "pakikisama" here, you can have friends
                easily and make a friendship that you've ever had. <sup>6</sup>This can also help you to communicate even if
                your under pressure, because this will taught you to be calm in every scenario and to think even if
                you are under pressure.<sup>7</sup> I'll share one of my memories about communication skills. <sup>8</sup>When i was in
                senior high school, i'm a bit shy because that's the year of pandemic here in Philippines.<sup>9</sup> When we
                came back to face to face, i can't talk to my schoolmates because i'm shy to have a interaction with
                them. But the week after that happened, i realized that having an communication helps me to be
                confident and expressing my emotions to them. <sup>10</sup>That week also is our class voting, and when i let my
                thoughts win, i easily win PRO in our schools.<sup>11</sup> That's why it helped me because it can benefit my
                life going in college. <sup>12</sup>When we are growing up, all of us felt shocked and anxiety because we don't
                know how our life's gonna be in the future.<sup>13</sup> But luckily, if you have Emotional Intelligence, you
                will be fine and you can talked to other people and make friends. <sup>14</sup>Communication skills and Emotional
                Intelligence are one of my skills, thankfully i learned them because it helps me here in Manila, and
                i'm thanking also my parents for helping me to develop that.<sup>15</sup> I developed Emotional Intelligence to
                myself because i based it on my own experiences in life, and my expression to the world.<sup>16</sup> If you have
                this three, your life can have an amazing story and compassion. <sup>17</sup>Because when u can express on
                someone, and listen to their opinion, our life will be good and can have a moral lesson on each and
                every decision that we make. <sup>18</sup>But always remember that a great skills comes at our house first.<sup>19</sup>
                Because when we have a skills like this, all thanks to our parents who taught us how to have a good
                skills and passion.<sup>20</sup> This lesson taught me to express my love and support to my parents for having me
                a great skills in life, people, and even to myself. </blockqoute>
