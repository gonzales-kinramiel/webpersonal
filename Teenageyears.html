        <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that Teenage years is the best years of our life
          because it's fun and we enjoy and we all have a core memories about this years.<sup>1</sup> So i took advantge and make
          the most of it, like always saying to myself that "You Only Live Once" or YOLO.<sup>2</sup> I always go with the flow on
          whats happening on my life back in the days.<sup>3</sup> But, that's the days that i chose to be close with God, because
          i join Youth for Christ.<sup>4</sup> It's a community of youth's for God, and it was a best choice that i done.<sup>5</sup> On first
          sight, i don't wanna join because i'm an introvert back then, but my siblings forced me to join because it
          is fun and full with love and acceptance.<sup>6</sup> So i joined YFC and at first, it was hard for me because i don't
          have confidence to talk with others.<sup>7</sup> But i just go with the flow and make friends on each and every people
          who's there in Camp.<sup>8</sup> And i'm gonna tell you that it change my life, because at this day, i still have that
          confidence to talk to others even though i'm not close to them, i'm a bit introvert now but it changes
          everyday because of my confidence.<sup>9</sup> It was the best choice that i did because it helped me physically and
          mentally, because of God, i can do things and God will always at my back to help me and guide me.<sup>10</sup> I also
          have a friends who is still my friends because of YFC, one of them also helped me on my depression when i
          was a teenager, and i'm so thankful for him, i'm not gonna say his name but i think when he read this, he's
          gonna know that i'm mentioning him.<sup>11</sup> So back on the days when i'm teenager, i remember when i was grade 9.<sup>12</sup> I
          have a friend who is mocking my classmates, he was mocking him at his back so he can't see it, so i told my
          classmate that "Oy tignan mo oh, niloloko ka nito ng nakatalikod ka" but i said that like it's a joke.<sup>13</sup> And i
          will tell you that my classmate ain't joking, he punch my friend at the chest, and my friend who took it
          offensive, punched him back at the side of the face, and that began them fighting for their life, like they
          are saying that "aabangan kita sa labas suntukan tayo dun!", and there was me, just laughing in the side.<sup>14</sup> So
          my teacher found out that they are fighting, so she called guidance and they always talking to each other
          that "ikaw ang nagpanguna e" and "hindi naman ako nagsimula!", then i admit to them that it's my fault, but
          i didn't get guidance because i'm not the one who fight them both.<sup>15</sup> But they threatened me saying that "dapat
          hindi mo ginawa yun, ikaw suntukin namin e", but their mood changed when i said "oh diba ako nag cause ng
          away nyo pero ako din ang dahilan kung bat kayo magbabati", and we laugh about on the day after they got
          guidance.<sup>16</sup> That was one of the most funniest things that i encountered.<sup>17</sup> One of the most achievements that i
          got when i was in my teenage years was being 1st place on battle of the bands.<sup>18</sup> Region 4-B always have an
          event every two years, and it's called "Regional Yourh Conference", and they always have an competetive
          event like battle of the bands, sports, spoken poetry, etc..<sup>19</sup> So me and my bandmates who is also a YFC,
          joined the battle of the band, and we are the youngest who joined there.<sup>20</sup> Kuya RR ( our kuya who taught us
          some basics in our instruments) told us that before we even practice, so we have a pressure because we only
          practice for about 4 momths and our competitors are always joining battle of the band.<sup>21</sup> But we didn't let
          pressure beat us, we always practice like everyday for 4 months, it was hard and challenging but we get out
          of our comfort zone and make the most of it.<sup>22</sup> On the day that we will perform na, our seniors and chapter
          head told us that win or lose, they are proud of us, we also didn't expect that we will win because our
          competitors has been bandmates for 4-5 years.<sup>23</sup> And when we are going up to the stage, i told them that "Okay
          lang yung maging kabado, okay lang ma pressure. pero tandaan nyo, proud ako sainyo kung ano kakalabasan
          natin. Gawin nyo lang yung na practice natin at i enjoy natin tong araw na to", and that gave them a
          breather and confidence, so we perform and it came out pretty well.<sup>24</sup> On the day that will announce who wins,
          we didn't care because we only did that for fun, but when the Occidental Mindoro was mentioned, we felt that
          we are the champion.<sup>25</sup> Our smiles and happiness burst on that scene, even the other chapters are happy for us
          and they didn't expect that we will win, our seniors and chapter head cries and burst with happiness too.<sup>26</sup> We
          proved them that even though we're the youngest, we have an tough heart and mind, we bring home a silver and
          that's like a gold to us.<sup>27</sup> </blockqoute>
