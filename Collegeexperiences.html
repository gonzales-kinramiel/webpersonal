                <blockqoute>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When i was going to college, i'm a bit pressured at the same time,
                  i'm a bit too shy because i'm having a hard time while going to college.<sup>1</sup> On the first day of college, i
                  didnt spoke to others because i'm shy.<sup>2</sup> But thankfully, John Mathew Sandalo and John Michael Caraig
                  approached me and said that if we can be friends.<sup>3</sup> so i said yes because i wanna explore on college and
                  make friends to others who is not in my province.<sup>4</sup> But they said that they made a bet on who's gonna
                  approach me and it was hilarious.<sup>5</sup> We always helped each other on certain things, like asking how to do the
                  code, asking activities and making activities, and having fun while doing things like reviewing and
                  groupings.<sup>6</sup> One of the most things that happened to me was we are at 1st year second sem, UE coach gave ma
                  an opportunity to play basketball on UE, and it was the best feeling i've ever gotten because that's my
                  dream and i'm having a step to achieve that dream.<sup>7</sup> So i worked hard everyday to pursue my dreams and to
                  have a free tuition.<sup>8</sup> So i started my training on February 20, 2024. but, certain things happened, i got
                  injured on April 15, 2024, and it was the worse day of my life.<sup>9</sup> April 22, 2024, we have a league called
                  PinoyLiga, it was a pre season of every schools and a fresh start to start the UAAP, but i got injured so
                  i didnt play.<sup>10</sup> I have a jersey on UE and it was all settled, i got to the roster and make the team.<sup>11</sup> The
                  doctors said that i can't play or even walk for about 4-6 weeks, when the doctors said that, my life and
                  dreams broke, i even insist my doctors that "Doc, pwede kaya ipa therapy ko nalang to" but the doctors
                  said no because i have a minor fracture on my right ankle.<sup>12</sup> That day, my hopes and dreams shattered and i
                  didn't reach my expectations.<sup>13</sup> i was depressed on that day and i have no hopes to play again.<sup>14</sup> But i didn't
                  let that slide, because when the day that i recovered from my injury, i go straight to my coach and said
                  that i wanna be back and i wanna be better and stronger.<sup>15</sup> So June 4 2024, the doctors removed my air cast
                  and able to play again after 2 months.<sup>16</sup> I got back to UE training on July 1, 2024, and they welcome me with
                  gratitude, they said that "gaw tagal mo nawala ah", and "welcome back pare!", that day my "gigil" got back
                  to play again.<sup>17</sup> But when UAAP season is coming, i didn't get my roster back, so i realized that i'm not
                  compatible at UE Men's basketball team, so right now i'm focus on studying and having a knowledge in IT
                  industry.<sup>18</sup> But, on 1st year 2nd sem, i got a failed in one subject, but i got it back because professors
                  did a remedial test.<sup>19</sup>Our professor have one condition to pass the test, to achieve the score that the
                  professor will say.<sup>20</sup> My score to pass is 78, out of 120, then the test ended and when i pressed the submit
                  button, my score is 79.<sup>21</sup> That day, i was so happy and so relief because i scored and i achieve the score
                  that my professor said.<sup>22</sup> And that's why i take my getbacks too serious and made 2nd year 1st sem seriously.
                  I don't know how 2nd year 2nd sem will take me, but i will let it go with the flow and will lift it to God
                  on what's happening and what will happen.<sup>23</sup> That's all for my sharing, i can't share anything that happened
                  to me because others a bit too conflict and too confidential, Thank you !<sup>24</sup></blockqoute>
